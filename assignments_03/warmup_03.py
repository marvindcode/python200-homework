iris = load_iris(as_frame=True)
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Preprocessing Question 1
## Split X and y into training and test sets using an 80/20 split with stratify=y and random_state=42. Print the shapes of all four arrays.

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y, random_state=42)

print("---Preprocessing Question 1----")
print("X_train shape:", X_train.shape)
print("X_test shape:", X_test.shape)
print("y_train shape:", y_train.shape)
print("y_test shape:", y_test.shape)


# Preprocessing Question 2
## Fit a StandardScaler on X_train and use it to transform both X_train and X_test. Print the mean of each column in X_train_scaled -- they should all be very close to 0. Add a comment explaining in one sentence why you fit the scaler on X_train only.

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

print("--Preprocessing Q2--")
print("Mean X_trained_scaled:", X_train_scaled.mean(axis=0))
print("Desc Std X_train_scaler:", X_train_scaled.std(axis=0))

#The scaler applies to the X_train only because if it's applied to all the data the meand and standard deviation are affected by the test set.  Wen is evaluate it later on the test set the model has seen it before, this is know as data leakage.



# KNN

#KNN Question 1
## Build a KNeighborsClassifier with n_neighbors=5, fit it on the unscaled training data (X_train), and predict on the test set. Print the accuracy score and the full classification report. 

knn_uns = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
knn_uns.fit(X_train, y_train)

preds_knn_uns = knn_uns.predict(X_test)

print("--KNN Q1--")
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, preds_knn_uns))
print("Classification report:", classification_report(y_test, preds_knn_uns))

# KNN Question 2
# Repeat KNN Question 1 using the scaled data (X_train_scaled, X_test_scaled). Print the accuracy score. Add a comment: does scaling improve performance, hurt it, or make no difference? Why might that be for this particular dataset?

knn_scl = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
knn_scl.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
preds_knn_scl = knn_scl.predict(X_test_scaled)

print("--KNN Q2--")
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, preds_knn_scl))
print("Classification report:", classification_report(y_test, preds_knn_scl))

# Scaling didn't improve the performance, affects because eventhoug doesn't lower by much is less than the unscaled, this is because the dataser scales are on similiar scales, so there is no benefit scaling it.


# KNN Question 3
# Using cross_val_score with cv=5, evaluate the k=5 KNN model on the unscaled training data. Print each fold score, the mean, and the standard deviation. Add a comment: is this result more or less trustworthy than a single train/test split, and why?

cv_scores = cross_val_score(KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5), X_train, y_train, cv=5)

print("--KNN Q3--")
print("Fold scores:", cv_scores)         
print("Mean:", cv_scores.mean())
print("Std:",  cv_scores.std())

#This result is more trustworthy than a train/test split because evaluates the model between multiple subset of data.


# KNN Question 4
# Loop over k values [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]. For each, compute 5-fold cross-validation accuracy on the unscaled training data and print k and the mean CV score. Add a comment identifying which k you would choose and why.

print("--KNN 4--")
k_values = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]

for k in k_values:
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)
    scores = cross_val_score(knn, X_train, y_train, cv=5)
    print(f"k={k:2d}:  mean={scores.mean():.3f}  std={scores.std():.3f}")

# I would chose k=7 because it has the highest mean, same as k=5 but with lower std of 0.020


# Classifier Evaluation Question 1
# Using your predictions from KNN Question 1, create a confusion matrix and display it with ConfusionMatrixDisplay, passing display_labels=iris.target_names. Save the figure to outputs/knn_confusion_matrix.png. Add a comment: which pair of species does the model most often confuse (if any)?

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, preds_knn_uns)
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(
    confusion_matrix=cm,
    display_labels=iris.target_names
)

disp.plot()
plt.title("KNN Confusion Matrix (Iris)")
plt.savefig("outputs/knn_confusion_matrix.png")
plt.show()
plt.close()

print("--Classifier Evaluation Q1")
print("Confussion matrix:", cm)

# There is no misclassification, acctualy doesn't confuse any.  Is perfect classification.


## The sklearn API: Decision Trees

# Decision Trees Question 1
# Create a DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=42), fit it on the unscaled training data, and predict on the test set. Print the accuracy score and classification report. Add a comment comparing the Decision Tree accuracy to KNN. Then add a second comment: given that Decision Trees don't rely on distance calculations, would scaled vs. unscaled data affect the result?

tree_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=42)
tree_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_prediction_tree = tree_model.predict(X_test)

print("--Decision Trees Q1--")
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_prediction_tree))
print("Classification_report:", classification_report(y_test, y_prediction_tree))

#The result of the Decision Tree is lower, no by much compared with the best KNN result of 0.975 vs the decision tree result of 0.967.  The difference between scaled vs. unscaled doesn't affect the decision tree because they split the data based on features instead of distances. 


## Logistic Regression and Regularization

# Logistic Regression Question 1
# Train three logistic regression models on the scaled Iris data, identical in every way except for the C parameter: C=0.01, C=1.0, and C=100. Use max_iter=1000 and solver='liblinear' for all three. For each model, print the C value and the total size of all coefficients using np.abs(model.coef_).sum(). Add a comment: what happens to the total coefficient magnitude as C increases? What does this tell you about what regularization is doing?

print("--- Logistic Regression Q1 ---")
for c_value in [0.01, 1.0, 100]:
    log_model = OneVsRestClassifier(
    LogisticRegression(C=c_value, max_iter=1000, solver='liblinear'))
    log_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

    # coef_size = np.abs(log_model.coef_).sum()
    all_coefs = np.vstack([est.coef_ for est in log_model.estimators_])
    coef_size = np.abs(all_coefs).sum()

    print("C:", c_value), ("total coefficient magnitude:", coef_size)

#The valiue of C is inverse to the coefficient magnitude, if the coefficient is larger the regularization is weaker, and if the coefficient is close to zero is related to a stronger regularization.

# PCA
# The digits dataset is a collection of 1797 small handwritten digit images, each 8x8 pixels, bundled directly with scikit-learn (no download needed). Each image is stored as a flat array of 64 pixel values, so each sample lives in a 64-dimensional space -- a natural fit for dimensionality reduction. Pixel values range from 0 to 16, with higher values representing brighter pixels. The target labels are the digits 0 through 9.

# Add this data-loading block right before your PCA questions in warmup_03.py:

digits = load_digits()
X_digits = digits.data    # 1797 images, each flattened to 64 pixel values
y_digits = digits.target  # digit labels 0-9
images   = digits.images  # same data shaped as 8x8 images for plotting


# PCA Question 1
# Print the shape of X_digits and images. Then create a 1-row subplot showing one example of each digit class (0-9), using cmap='gray_r' with each digit's label as the title. Save the figure to outputs/sample_digits.png. (gray_r is the reversed grayscale colormap -- it renders higher pixel values as darker, so digits appear as dark ink on a light background, which is more readable than the default.)

print("--- PCA Q1 ---")
print("X_digits shape:", X_digits.shape)
print("images shape:", images.shape)

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 10, figsize=(8, 6))

for digit in range(10):
    first_idx = np.where(y_digits == digit)[0][0]
    axes[digit].imshow(images[first_idx], cmap='gray_r')
    axes[digit].set_title(str(digit))
    axes[digit].axis("off")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig("outputs/sample_digits.png")
plt.show()
plt.close()

# PCA Question 2
# Fit PCA() on X_digits (with no n_components argument) then get the scores with scores = pca.transform(X_digits). As in the lesson, scores tell you how strongly each component is weighted for each sample -- scores[i, 0] is the weighting for PC1 in sample i, scores[i, 1] is the weighting for PC2, and so on.
# Use scores[:, 0] and scores[:, 1] to make a scatter plot, coloring each point by its digit label and adding a colorbar. Here is the pattern for coloring by a label array and attaching a colorbar:
# scatter = plt.scatter(scores[:, 0], scores[:, 1], c=y_digits, cmap='tab10', s=10)  # c = color array
# plt.colorbar(scatter, label='Digit')
# Save the figure to outputs/pca_2d_projection.png. Add a comment: do same-digit images tend to cluster together in this 2D space?

pca = PCA()
pca.fit(X_digits)
scores = pca.transform(X_digits)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
scatter = plt.scatter(scores[:, 0], scores[:, 1], c=y_digits, cmap='tab10', s=10)
plt.colorbar(scatter, label='Digit')
plt.xlabel("PC1")
plt.ylabel("PC2")
plt.title("PCA 2D Projection of Digits")
plt.savefig("outputs/pca_2d_projection.png")
plt.close()

print("--- PCA Q2 ---")
print("PCA 2D projection saved.")

#Do the same-digit images cluster together? yes, same digit images tend to cluster togheter.  It could happen that two principal components don't capture all variation.


# PCA Question 3
# Using the PCA object you fit in Question 2, plot cumulative explained variance vs. number of components using np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_). Save to outputs/pca_variance_explained.png. Add a comment: approximately how many components do you need to explain 80% of the variance?

cumulative_variance = np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(range(1, len(cumulative_variance) + 1), cumulative_variance)
plt.xlabel("Number of Components")
plt.ylabel("Cumulative Explained Variance")
plt.title("PCA Variance Explained")
plt.savefig("outputs/pca_variance_explained.png")
plt.close()

print("--- PCA Q3 ---")
print("First few cumulative variance values:")
print(cumulative_variance[:10])

#About how many components explain 80% of variance? To explain 80% of the variance is needed 10 principal components.   


# PCA Question 4
# The preprocessing lesson showed that a reconstruction is built by starting from the mean and adding each component weighted by its score. Here is the same idea generalized to n components -- add this function to your file:

def reconstruct_digit(sample_idx, scores, pca, n_components):
    """Reconstruct one digit using the first n_components principal components."""
    reconstruction = pca.mean_.copy()
    for i in range(n_components):
        reconstruction = reconstruction + scores[sample_idx, i] * pca.components_[i]
    return reconstruction.reshape(8, 8)


# Using this function, the PCA object, and the scores from Question 2, reconstruct the first 5 digits in X_digits using reconstruction through principal components n = 2, 5, 15, and 40.
# Build a grid of subplots where rows correspond to each n value and columns show those 5 digits. Add an "Original" row at the top (use images[i], which is already shaped as (8, 8)). Save to outputs/pca_reconstructions.png.
# Add a comment: at what n do the digits become clearly recognizable, and does that match where the variance curve levels off?

n_values = [2, 5, 15, 40]
sample_indices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

fig, axes = plt.subplots(len(n_values) + 1, len(sample_indices), figsize=(12, 8))


for col, idx in enumerate(sample_indices):
    axes[0, col].imshow(images[idx], cmap='gray_r')
    axes[0, col].set_title(f"Original {y_digits[idx]}")
    axes[0, col].axis("off")

# Reconstruction rows
for row, n in enumerate(n_values, start=1):
    for col, idx in enumerate(sample_indices):
        reconstructed = reconstruct_digit(idx, scores, pca, n)
        axes[row, col].imshow(reconstructed, cmap='gray_r')
        axes[row, col].set_title(f"n={n}")
        axes[row, col].axis("off")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig("outputs/pca_reconstructions.png")
plt.show()
plt.close()

print("-- PCA Q4 ---")
print("PCA reconstructions saved.")

# It is more recognizable at n=15 components.That matches were the curve levels off around 10 components.
